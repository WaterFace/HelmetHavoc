His homeland ravaged by bands of mercenaries, our hero 
seeks a mighty weapon to use against the fearsome bandits.
In his quest for arms, our hero finds the mouth of an
ancient cave. In the depths of the cave, he finds not a 
sword, hammer, or spear, but a strange helmet, and a 
mysterious device to be strapped to one's back.
Armed with these peculier implements, our hero begins
his journey to save his home.
